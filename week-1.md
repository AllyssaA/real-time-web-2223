### Excersise 1: Basic setup

#### Readme (Thursday)
[Fork this repo][repo]
This week you’re going to recreate [this basic chat app][socket.io] with the addition of at least one new feature. Write down what your project’s all about in the readme of the project. Next week you’ll start a new project so a basic readme for this week will do.

*Resources:* [readme driven development][rdd], [mastering markdown][markdown]
*Note:* keep the docs up-to-date while working on your project.

#### Style (Thursday) 
Maybe you already have a preferred code-style, maybe you want to try something else.
Set up at least an [npm script][npm], and probably also some integration with your editor. Use Nodemon or similar to allow instant reloading while developing.

*Resources:* [xo][x0], [standard][standard], [prettier][prettier], [eslint][eslint]

#### Server (Thursday)
Set-up Express (or similar) for static file serving / templating

*Resources:* [express api][express api]
